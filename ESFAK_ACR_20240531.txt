Spring Breakup and Flood Potential Summary


Current Conditions as of May 31:
* With the exception of the North Slope rivers, all major river systems across the state are completely open and ice free.
* Along the North Slope there is a fairly uniform, though shallow, snowpack remaining from the winter.  Snow along the lower elevation northern slopes of the Brooks Range has been greatly depleted from recent warm temperatures. 
* Rivers on the North Slope are beginning to open up.  
   * The Sagavanirktok River is mostly open down to about the Franklin Bluffs with areas of aufeis seen further downstream.  Water is flowing out of the mouth into the Arctic Ocean.  Webcams along the Sag river and a UAF river gage all show water levels have been steadily rising this week, though still well within bank.
   * The Kuparuk River is also beginning to open up though there seems to still be plenty of in-place ice on the lower half of the river.  Water on top of ice can be seen at the mouth of the river.
   * The Colville River has plenty of open areas and separated ice sheets along most of the river, especially at and a little bit downstream of the confluence with the Anaktuvuk River, which is mostly open.  Water can be seen flowing out of the river mouth over in-place sea ice.
* Water levels at Fort Yukon have dropped through the week after cresting earlier this week.  The Porcupine River has steadily receded this week, though recent warm temperatures have restarted snow melt in the headwaters causing the Porcupine at Old Crow to begin to rise.  
Forecast Conditions
* Temperatures are expected to fall well below average across the North Slope this weekend through mid week, with temperatures generally ranging between the mid 20s and mid 30s.  Snow is also likely during the first half of next week.  This will slow breakup along the rivers until warmer temperatures arrive by the end of next week.
* For the Porcupine, temperatures are expected to warm into the mid 60s-70s through the weekend, leading to increased snowmelt rates in the headwaters and slowly rising water levels in Fort Yukon by next week, though no flooding is expected.

Climate Outlook


The Climate Prediction Center temperature outlook for the 2nd week of June indicates an increased chance of warmer than normal temperatures for the northern half of Alaska and normal temperatures for the rest of the state, except for the southwest coast, where there is a slight tilt towards cooler than normal temperatures.
