Build Hourly Fix

1)	 Pull the attached script (process_hourly.pl) into AWIPS and put it into: /localapps/runtime/bin
2)	 Make sure the script is executable:   chmod 755 process_hourly.pl
3)	 Fix the run_build_hourly script:

cd /awips2/edex/data/share/hydroapps/precip_proc/local/bin
sudo vi ./run_build_hourly
Edit line 47 (approx.) and change: 
TYPE_HANDLING=PTYPE              # SAME / PTYPE  
to:
TYPE_HANDLING=SAME              # SAME / PTYPE     

Add a new line after: 
echo " " >>$BUILD_HOURLY_LOGFILE
echo "Process resulting hourly file... " >>$BUILD_HOURLY_LOGFILE

Add this line : 
/localapps/runtime/bin/process_hourly.pl $END_TIME >>$BUILD_HOURLY_LOGFILE 2>&1

Save the file.
Save a backup copy of the file:
sudo cp ./run_build_hourly  ./run_build_hourly.backup

Wait until the next fielgen run happens.  Usually it runs at 25 minues after the hour.  
So around 30 past, check for the data using XDAT or psql.
Check for the data in MPE.

Sometimes during an AWIPS software build install, the precip_proc scripts get ovewritten,  but 
if you save a backup copy you can get it back easily.
